**For the first time writing a mod, there may be some deficiencies in the numerical value of the item and the quality of the module. If there are any areas that you feel are inappropriate, please report them on GitHub.**

**Ported [Mekanism Evolution](https://github.com/Pocky-l/Mekanism-Evolution) to 1.20.1 and added some other things**

**My textures drawing may not be very good. If you want to provide better textures, you can contact me.**

### **All textures of Cosmic and Infinite are flickering, please do not use them if you are sensitive to glare.** ###

**The configuration file can be modified in the "mekanism_extras.toml" file located in the "Mekanism" folder.**

## A KNOWN BUG:

**Note: It is known that energy and chemical pipes will not save the contents of the pipes after exiting the game. Please export the contents of the pipes before exiting the game.**

**Fluid pipes and their code are almost the same. I don't know why fluid pipes can store things inside pipes while they can't (annoy), but the original mod also has this bug(happy).**
